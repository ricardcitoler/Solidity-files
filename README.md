# Solidity-files
Here you can find random files i got from my practice with solidity. All this exercices have been generated by ChatGPT so some of them doesn`t make sense. 
Any ways remember that are jsut practice exercices.

I'm sorry for those that don't understand Spanish, the exercices are comented in Sapnish due to is my mother tongue and it's more comfortable
for me when i have to revise some parts. But i'm sure you have techniques to translate them if you are interested in (google translate, chat gpt... u know) :)
